3) Terminal support
3.1) If you use gVim / a modern terminal

👍 The colorscheme will work out of the box. No need to setup anything else!
3.2) If the colors seem to be wrong

If your terminal supports 256 colors (see this script if you want to test your terminal), you may need to set t_Co to 256 and possibly also reset the t_ut value in your .vimrc before setting the colorscheme:

set t_Co=256
set t_ut=
colorscheme codedark

(Additionally, if you don't want to or cannot use t_Co, you can let g:codedark_term256=1.)
